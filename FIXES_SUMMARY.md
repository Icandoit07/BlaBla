## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Profile Page Prisma Error ✅

**Error:**
```
Unknown field `id` for select statement on model `Follow`
```

**Cause:**  
The Follow model doesn't have an `id` field in the schema.

**Fix:**  
Changed the followers query in `/src/app/u/[username]/page.tsx`:
```typescript
// Before (❌ Error)
select: { id: true }

// After (✅ Fixed)
select: { followerId: true }
```
